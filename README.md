- 👋 Hi, I’m @bbewnoremac
- 👀 I’m interested in theatre, music, and education, currently looking at how to incorporate tech/coding into these fields. This is both to help with future job prospects, and to help serve fields that I feel are currently underrepresented in tech/coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end development through The Odin Project, as well as exploring SQL through an audited Coursera course, SQL for Data Science from UC Davis.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, but excited to learn and eventually start on some larger-scale stuff!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/they!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have double-jointed wrists, meaning I can clap with one hand!
